Assignment #1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of the assignment is to simply combine all 6 of these programs into a single
program that will recursively read a series of data files in CSV format and enter 
them into a single database table.

The program must log the amount of time it takes to read the files in each directory 
and the time it takes to write the files to a file using the logger.

Output folder contains two files one with valid rows i.e. Output.csv and other
with invalid rows i.e. OutputError.csv.
Logs folder contains log file i.e.OutputLogfile.log.
